    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The easiest ramen you will ever make in less than 30 min. And it's so much
      tastier (and healthier) than the store-bought version!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>4</strong> chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)</li>
      <li>kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to season</li>
      <li><strong>2</strong> tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li><strong>4</strong> tsp sesame or vegetable oil</li>
      <li><strong>4</strong> tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
      <li><strong>2</strong> tbsp fresh garlic, minced</li>
      <li><strong>6</strong> tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li><strong>4</strong> tbsp mirin</li>
      <li><strong>8</strong> cup rich chicken stock</li>
      <li><strong>2</strong> oz dried shitake mushrooms (or 1 cup fresh)</li>
      <li><strong>2–4</strong> tsp sea salt, to taste</li>
      <li><strong>4</strong> large eggs</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> cup scallions, sliced</li>
      <li><strong>4 (3 oz)</strong> packs dried ramen noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <h4>Cook the chicken</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the
        chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and
        releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over
        and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the
        chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to
        a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Make The Ramen Broth</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the
        garlic and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the
        soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let
        simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer
        gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assemble The Ramen Bowls:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken
        into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen
        noodles to the boiling water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large
        bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the fresh
        scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!
